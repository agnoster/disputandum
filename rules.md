# Disputandum - The game of civil discourse

Draft rules

## Introduction

Disputandum is a card game for civilized individuals who enjoy a good debate. Most games require a sense of sportsmanship: the willingness to stick to the rules and spirit of the game, even when it is not strictly the optimal method for winning. In Disputandum, a true win is having a good debate, and learning more about the intellectual tools for achieving this. It requires players who are able to acknowledge when their opponent's point is valid, even if its not to edit advantage. In return, Disputandum can reward players with deep and challenging debates and enhanced knowledge of rhetorical devices, methods of inference, and logical fallacies. 

## Requirements

- A deck of Device cards. Device cards are either Logic, Rhetoric, or Fallacy.
- 2 Vote cards per player, 1 Aye and 1 Nay each.
- 1 Role card per player.
- A set of blank cards for writing down arguments and stipulations *OR* a notepad, in a pinch.
- A set of tokens (go stones, coins, whatever) to represent Credibility points. 
- A board to play on, able to represent 5 slots with 2 sides each.

## Mechanics

### Voting

Certain moves will be subject to a *vote*. When a vote occurs, each player plays a Vote card face-down. As soon as all players have placed a card, the cards are turned over. Any players voting with the minority lose 1 Credibility.

### Roles

There are three different roles, which may be mixed and matched to create different debate configurations.

- A *Champion* must vote *for* the resolution in the final vote.
- An *Adversary* must vote *against* the resolution in the final vote.
- A *Seeker* may vote for or against the resolution.

The standard configuration is 1 Champion, 1 Adversary, and the rest Seekers. However, one could also play a game with 2 Champions, 2 Adversaries, and 1 Seeker (playing the role in this case of judge).

### Bets

Before making or rebutting an argument the player may place Logic or Rhetoric cards in front of them to “bet” that they will use them successfully. If they succeed in using a Device, they receive the number of points indicated on the card; if they fail, they lose 1 point. Whether a player succeeded or failed is determined by a vote on each device.

### Fallacies

When a player uses a logical fallacy that another player has in their hand, player B can play the card. If (by a vote) the fallacy is found to have been used, the infringing player must pay the number of credibility points to the one who played the card. If the vote fails, the player loses 1 Credibility point for calling wolf.

### The Board

The board represents 5 arguments either for or against. The simplest version is a 5x2 grid, where each square can hold a small set of tokens. Part of a Mancala board can work, or simply drawing a 5x2 grid on paper.

## Phases

### Setup

First, choose a debate topic. This might be either chosen by agreement, or from a queue of topics the group finds interesting, or from a random debate topic generator. The topic takes the form of a concrete Resolution, such as "Resolved: The UN Security Council veto should be abolished."

Each player receives 2 Vote cards (1 Aye, 1 Nay) and 1 Role card. How the Roles are distributed depends on the preferences of the group, but the standard play is to assemble a set of 1 Adversary, 1 Champion, and N-2 Seekers, and to deal the cards out to each player randomly. Players do not reveal their role until the end of the debate.

Each player receives 10 Credibility points. 

Finally, each player receives 7 cards from the Deck. During play, players will draw cards such that they always have 7 in their hand at the end of their turn. 

### Debate

Starting to the dealer's left, each player goes in turn. On a turn, a player may make one of 3 moves: Stipulate, Argue, or Rebut.

#### Stipulate

A player may Stipulate a fact or belief that should be taken as axiomatic of the purpose of the debate. They are used to clarify the scope of the argument, or to set the assumptions upon which arguments must be based.

A player writes a stipulation on a blank card (or on the notepad). A simple majority vote on whether the stipulation is acceptable follows. The player proposing the stipulation takes a penalty of 1 Credibility for each Nay vote. If the stipulation does not receive a majority, it fails and is discarded or stricken from the notepad. If it passes, it remains on the table.

#### Argue

A player may make an argument for or against the resolution, placing 1 Credibility point of their own on the board in the appropriate slot. The argument is captured in writing, then the player has 2 minutes to make an argument for the statement. At the end of the argument, all players vote on whether the argument was valid - i.e. logically consistent, cohesive, and not in contradiction with the stipulations. If the argument passes, the proposing player receives 1 Credibility point from the bank.

#### Rebut

A player may rebut an argument, placing 1 Credibility of their own on the board across from the argument they are rebutting. They proceed just like making an argument, except that at the end the vote is on whether the rebuttal was convincing that the argument is no longer valid - i.e. that it is not logical, or that it is in contradiction with a stipulation.

### Endgame

When the board is “full” - each of the five slots is occupied with an argument, rebutted or standing - play continues until all players have had an equal number of turns.

Then, all players vote on the resolution - whether they are convinced the resolution is true, based on the arguments made. In the final vote, all players in the majority receive an extra 5 points, with no penalty for dissent.

Each player's total points are the sum of their personal credibility points, the points on the side of the debate they chose in the final vote, plus the 5 bonus points if they were in the majority. The player with the most points wins, although it is intended to play a few rounds and sum all the points from each round.
